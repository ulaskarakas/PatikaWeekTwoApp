# Patika - Week Two App

This is a C# console application created as part of a weekly learning challenge, focusing on basic programming concepts, including variables, loops, methods, and user input handling.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this application is to provide a hands-on learning experience for beginners in C# programming. Through a series of exercises, users can practice basic programming concepts such as variable declarations, loops, conditionals, methods, and user input handling. Each exercise is designed to help reinforce fundamental programming skills and encourage problem-solving techniques in a structured way. This project aims to strengthen the understanding of C# syntax and logic while also promoting good coding practices.

## Application Features


The application includes various coding exercises that demonstrate fundamental programming skills. Each section of the code is designed to perform specific tasks:

1. **Basic Output**: Prints a multi-line message to the console.
2. **Variable Assignment**: Demonstrates the use of string and integer variables.
3. **Random Number Generation**: Generates and displays a random number.
4. **Modulo Operation**: Generates a random number and displays its remainder when divided by 3.
5. **User Input**: Takes the user's age and prints a symbol based on whether they are 18 or older.
6. **Looping**: Repeats a sentence 10 times.
7. **Swapping Variables**: Swaps the values of two strings (names).
8. **Void Method**: Defines a method that outputs a message without returning a value.
9. **Addition Method**: Defines a method to return the sum of two numbers.
10. **Boolean Validation**: Takes a boolean input and returns a string based on its value.
11. **Max Age Finder**: Determines the oldest age from three input values.
12. **Max Number Finder**: Finds the largest number from an array of numbers.
13. **Swap Names Method**: Swaps the values of two names using `ref` parameters.
14. **Even/Odd Check**: Determines if a given number is even or odd.
15. **Distance Calculation**: Calculates the distance traveled based on speed and time.
16. **Circle Area Calculation**: Computes the area of a circle given its radius.
17. **String Manipulation**: Converts a sentence to uppercase and lowercase.
18. **Trim Whitespace**: Removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.
